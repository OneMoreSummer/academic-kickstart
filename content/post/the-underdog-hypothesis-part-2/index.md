It has been found that later born ([BQ](https://onemoresummer.co.uk/post/what-is-birth-quarter/) 4) players reach higher elite levels than early born (BQ 1) players in many sports such as NHL, Rugby Union and Cricket. This ‘effect’ is potentially explained by the ‘[Underdog Hypothesis](https://onemoresummer.co.uk/post/what-is-the-underdog-effect/)’. It states, in a similar way that the ‘Younger Sibling Effect’ works, that the constant extra challenge improves players more over time.

This makes perfect sense. But are we attributing too much to the Underdog Hypothesis?

Why do Q4 graduate at a much higher rate? Is it simply because they are just better quality from the start and have more potential. Why do Q1 graduate at a much lower rate? Is it simply because they are just lower quality from the start with less potential.

Should we simply select less Q1 to improve the quality and improve their graduation rate and select more Q4 as we are missing some completely from the pathway.



**How difficult would this be for a County Age Group (CAG) squad of 20?** 

Answer NOT that difficult, if there is a will bcs the data tells you it makes sense.

Typically we have Q1 7, Q2 7, Q3 4, Q4 2.

Select 2 less Q1 & Q2 from 7

Select 1 more Q3

Select 3 more Q4



**Would we lose the Underdog Effect?**

No. Even with 5:5:5:5 then the 5 Q4 are up against 15 older kids. They will still have to battle it out. It’s not 2 against 18, which is obviously harder for the 2, but only by a sixth (17%).



**Swings and Roundabouts** 

What you lose (-17%) on the underdog effect swings you gain on the (+150%) more Q4 roundabouts. Also fewer Q1s will be spared dropping out of the pathway at later stages.
