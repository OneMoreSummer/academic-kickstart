**Are Q1 batters more suited to shorter formats? What other evidence exists?**

In male England T20I cricket 25% of players (2005-2020) were Q1 but this was the highest Birth Quarter (BQ) for accumulated matches within this cohort at 28% and Q1s had the longest careers.

In male England ODI cricket 27% of players (2000-2020) were Q1 but these players only represented 22% of all matches played and had the shortest careers of all BQs.

In male England Test cricket only 22% of players (2000-2020) were Q1, representing only 12.3% of all matches played. They also had the shortest careers.  

**When looking at the very best players in each format these distinctions are more clear.**(Best are Top 50 batters by Runs, approx top 10% of all players in Test cricket)

In Test cricket only 14% of players are Q1s and they make up a similar number of overall matches played by this cohort.
