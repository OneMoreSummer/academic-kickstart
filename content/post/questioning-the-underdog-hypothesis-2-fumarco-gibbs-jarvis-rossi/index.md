\#1 Gibbs, Jarvis & Dufur (2012)

**Fumarco, Gibbs, Jarvis, & Rossi (2017)**

Main findings:

1. Q4 score more and command higher salaries than Q1.
2. This difference is more pronounced within the 90% percentile. +9 points/season and +51% of salary.

Let’s look further:

1. Only differences in Scores & Salaries between Q4 and Q1 were found. No differences between Q4 and Q2/Q3. In some cases Q2 or Q3 were the highest!

So what they really found over-selected Q1 not as good as the other Birth Quarters.



Scores:

% of Player-season observations:

30:28:22:20 (58:42) 38% more H1 than H2

BQ Avg score: 16.7 (-15%), 19.2 (-3%), 21.8 (+10%), 21.3 (+8%)
