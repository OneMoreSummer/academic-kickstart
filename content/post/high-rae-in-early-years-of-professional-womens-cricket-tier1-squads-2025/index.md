P﻿roject Darwin has created eight Tier 1 teams for 2025 playing the top level of domestic women's cricket in England. This analysis looked at the birth dates of all players as well as how the RAE profile of squads potentially changes during a professional career.

1﻿40 players were split into three tertiles, Rookie (17-21), Prime (21-26) & Veteran (26-34).
