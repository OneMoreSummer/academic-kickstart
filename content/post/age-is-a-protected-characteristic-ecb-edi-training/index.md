The ECB have produced an excellent [EDI online training module for recreational cricket](https://antidiscriminationrecreationalgame.ecb.co.uk/). This is, in part, a response to recent findings of racism in cricket as discussed by the DCMS committee for example.Â 

The module explains that age is one of the protected characteristics within the [ECB Anti-Discrimination Code (2022)](https://resources.ecb.co.uk/ecb/document/2022/03/17/36918e2a-b649-489a-9295-ea3bb6b5d433/ECB_Anti-Discrimination_Code_2022_v5-1-.pdf).

The module also includes the following statements:

1. **It is unlawful to treat someone less, or more, favourably because of their age.**
2. **Indirect discrimination is putting rules, policies or arrangements in place that apply to everyone but put someone with a protected characteristic at a particular disadvantage.**

So it is **unlawful** to discriminate because of **age** indirectly through rules, policies or arrangements.

Every year the ECB hold an event for Regional U15s. This **arrangement** forms the first stage of the ECB international pathway. The ECB has a **rule** that players are only allowed to play if they are 14 or under on the 31st August of the previous year. This is a chosen cut-off date.

If you are born in the first three months of this administrative year (i.e. September, October and November) you are **4x more likely** to be selected for the Regional U15s than if you are born at the end of the administrative year (June, July & August) (Kelly et al, 2021). This seems like **a particular disadvantage** and **treating someone less favourably because of their age**. These figures are known and quoted by the ECB yet they have a **policy** of ignoring them.

Is this therefore unlawful? Is it, at the very least, a breach of the ECB Anti-Discrimination Code (2022)?
