In most sports, especially team sports, it has been well documented that Relative Age Effects exist in development pathways. Football, rugby, ice hockey, tennis and cricket are all susceptible.

Whereas most of these sports are played virtually all year around or have the option of playing indoors, cricket is somewhat different. It isn’t played in the rain. It isn’t played all year around.

In fact it is only played professionally for half of the year and at developmental stages often for only a few months. The timing of these playing periods are always the same, spring and summer. Unlike say swimming and indeed football that compete all year around, cricket is very particular and very specific.

As a result, for players on the cricket development pathway, performance is judged over the same short period every year. When you combine this with the fixed cut off dates used in age grouping it means some players will benefit and some will be at a disadvantage. Every single year.

This contributes to why we find RAEs in cricket and why developing players who were born  in first half of the the academic year will always have played one more summer.

In fact often players identified early in the system as ‘potential’ stars start playing/training at say U9 when only U8. These are often early born and as well as playing an extra year they often also ‘play up’ every year, i.e. getting twice as many valuable opportunities to develop experience as a ‘normal’ player. This is not uncommon and is often the back story for many successful players (if they don’t burn out).

Cricket is also more prone than some (not all) sports to be dominated by a few (sometimes just one) players in a team of eleven. Often early born players will bat high in the order, be one of the first bowlers and especially be captain. 

Now if there is one way of demonstrating the various effects that can exist between coaches and players then making someone captain (often for an entire season and perhaps for every season) is it.

The Matthew effect is when players who get all the opportunities to then get further opportunities (‘rich get richer’) and the Pygmalion and Galatea effects are where the coach expects the players to do well and the later where the player expects (and consequently often does) expect to do well. As a perennial captain during the development pathway this have an effect on your psychosocial skills and confidence levels.

In contrast , late born players often make up the numbers and are given very few opportunities especially when they ‘fail’ as they haven’t had the opportunities to learn to succeed. Catch 22.
