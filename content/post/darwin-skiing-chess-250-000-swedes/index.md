What has Darwin got to do with X-Country Skiing, Alpine Skiing, Call of Duty, Chess and almost 250,000 Swedes?

A recent paper from researchers at Umea University in Sweden looked at how younger athletes fare in both individual & team sports, physical and non-physical sports and across most age groups and both sexes.

**Darwinian Selection Discriminates Young Athletes: the Relative Age Effect in Relation to Sporting Performance**

<https://sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40798-021-00300-2>

**Key Points:**

Massive Study across many sports

It contrasted physical sports with cognitive ‘sports’ e-sports & chess

RAE found in all sports in children and for both sexes.

Some evidence that the more physical a sport then the more RAE.

RAE highest in younger age groups. Declines till 20.

RAE reversal in adults in e-sports.

No correlation between Birthdate and Performance at Elite or Recreational levels.

Discusses the impact on elite teams - skewed player ID to early borns

Discusses the potential negative impact on participation and public health

The authors state ‘*Age-group division benefits relatively older athletes, while increasing the risk of injury and early dropout from sports among children born later in the season.*’

**You mentioned Darwin?**

Some research has suggested that Darwin’s theory of evolution is at play. When isn’t it? And that the way later borns rebalance the percentages in senior (professional) sport and also seem to excel at the very highest levels, despite being a significant minority during the pathway, is an ‘Survival of the Fittest’. Jones(2019) for the ECB calls this process an Evolution of the Fittest and saves the ‘Survival of the Fittest’ description for how early borns dominate the pathway. 

This study suggests that as RAE exists in the pathway (up to age 20?) and then diminishes to not being significant after this.  

‘Thus, it can be concluded that “survival of the fittest” in sports is skewed by \[a] less-than-optimal selection system and \[that the] “fittest of the selected” \[is] a more appropriate term.
