One of the ways to address the Relative Age Effect (RAE) found in cricket is to use age-ordered shirt numbering in trials.

Trials in cricket are ubiquitous. Often numbered bibs are used during trials to aid identification. A study by David Mann et al at PSV Eindhoven football club found that by following this fairly simple and easy strategy RAE was reduced.

I’ve not seen this in any trials, club, district, county, Bunbury (Regional U15s), Super Fours (Regional U17/18s). Does anyone use this in cricket?



**What did the study find?**

‘Talent scouts from an elite football club watched junior games and ranked players on the basis of their potential. Scouts were allocated to one of three groups provided with contrasting information about the age of the players: (1) no age information, (2) players' birthdates or (3) knowledge that the numbers on the playing shirts corresponded to the relative age of the players.'

'Results revealed a significant selection bias for the scouts in the no-age information group, and that bias remained when scouts knew the players' dates-of-birth. Strikingly though, the selection bias was eliminated when scouts watched the games knowing the shirt numbers corresponded to the relative ages of the players.’
