Birth Quarter is the 3 month period that some is born in within a single academic year. For the UK this will be:

Quarter 1 (Q1) : September-November

Quarter 2 (Q2) : December-February

Quarter 3 (Q3) : March-May

Quarter 4 (Q4) : June-August

Sometimes you will see H1 and H2. These are abbreviations for the two halves of the year. So H1 is Q1 & Q2. H2 is Q3 & Q4. Comparing these two values can give an idea of the amount of RAE and this ratio can be described as RAEi (RAE Index). 

The academic year is also used for age grouping in UK cricket.

Other countries around the world use different start dates for Quarter 1:

January/February
Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Scotland

April
India

September
UK, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, West Indies, Ireland
