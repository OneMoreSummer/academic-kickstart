After todays’ play (Ind v Eng 2nd Test 13.2.2021), ex-England captain Michael Vaughan tweeted *‘I like Pant. He’s quite the character. I’d like to ask a psychologist how you can get that confident at such a young age.'*

We know the importance of confidence as a huge factor in sport performance. Having young players who are ‘naturally’ more confident than others in a player development pathway is very attractive to coaches. But can coaches be mistaken in their assessment of a player’s confidence? Do they overvalue external representations of confidence like being loud, noisy and boisterous? Are coaches part of the problem by reinforcing behaviors that are often the result of [Relative Age Effects](https://onemoresummer.co.uk/post/what-is-relative-age-effect/)?

Rishabh Pant may or may not have been an early maturer. We don’t know. What we do know is he is an early born (October, [Birth Quarter](https://onemoresummer.co.uk/post/what-is-birth-quarter/) Q1) and we do know that he played for India U19s. We know that if you are an England U19 you are twice as likely to be a Q1/Q2 than Q3/Q4.

Early borns are often stronger, quicker. These physical advantages lead to psychosocial advantages in the early and middle parts of development. They are often the ones that have a go first, speak first, speak over and generally assert themselves more. Why? Because they have gained/maintained confidence from, for example:

* Being better than your peers

  Mentorship and belief of coaches

  Reflecting on good performances

  Faith in your skillset

Do coaches and development environments counter this confidence bias? Do they understand it? Or do they amplify it through the following effects:

**Matthew Effect** - hidden talents are missed, only the obvious, visible ones are valued.

**Pygmalion Effect** - Is a self-fulfilling prophecy where players develop better or worse than other players based on the way their coach expects them to develop.

**Galatea Effect** - Is another self-fulfilling prophecy where players develop better or worse than other players based on the way they themselves expect to develop.

Perhaps one reason, amongst many other complex factors, that Pant is a confident guy is his birthdate advantage and his subsequent player pathway experience.
