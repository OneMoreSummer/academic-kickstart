**In T20 cricket we select slightly more early born England Women yet late borns have careers almost twice as long.** 

In general there is a [Relative Age Effect](https://onemoresummer.co.uk/post/what-is-relative-age-effect/) in women’s sport pathways but it is often less significant than in men’s sport. RAE is found in the England Women’s T20 team (Q1 30%, Q4 18%) over the period 2004-2021*.

But when we look at how many [games these players play over a career](https://onemoresummer.co.uk/post/matches-played-by-birth-quarter/) a different picture emerges. On average Q4 players play 45.7 matches whereas Q1 play only 14.7. The return for Q2 players is slightly better at 30.2 but is overshadowed by Q3 at 47.7. So later born (Q3/Q4) play for longer than early born (Q1/Q2).

Similar results are found in the [England Womens ODI (50 over) team](https://onemoresummer.co.uk/post/relative-age-effect-in-womens-cricket-engalnd-odi-selection/). On average a Q1 career consists of 18 matches whereas Q4 play almost 3 times that figure at 52. There appears to be a familiar Q1/Q2 v Q3/Q4 effect.

**RAE Reversals**

In men’s cricket similar RAE Reversals have been shown where later borns, although selected far less, actually reach higher levels within the game. To explain this Collins, McCarthy & Court (2016) described an [Underdog Effect](https://onemoresummer.co.uk/post/what-is-the-underdog-effect/) in cricket as well as rugby union. They proposed that younger, smaller, weaker, players have to work harder to survive than their relatively older counterparts and consequently become better players eventually.

It is important to state that it is not clear if Relative Age and Underdog Effects work to the same exrent in the women’s pathway as the mens.
