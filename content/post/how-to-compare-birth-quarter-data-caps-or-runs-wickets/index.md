**Player % v Match %**

Just counting the number of players in a [Birth Quarter](https://onemoresummer.co.uk/post/what-is-birth-quarter/) out of a cohort values them equally. Using the percentage of all matches played by the cohort gives an over weighting to the very best and vica versa. I think it is useful to combine these two values in all charts. 

**Caps v Runs/Wickets**

Most Relative Age Effect (RAE) research uses unweighted player data. When studying the highest performing players ever, it is mostly done using the number of matches played as a qualifying factor.

When comparing the outcomes of data by caps or runs/wickets we find that there is good correlation for runs/batters but potential mis-matches for wickets/bowlers. This is because batters tend to have longer careers than bowlers and therefor are more likely to qualify above a minimum level of caps.

For example, in a recent study of male England Test Cricketers only 3 batters in the top 50 by runs hadn’t reached 50 caps, whereas half (25) bowlers in the top 50 by wickets hadn’t reached 50 caps.
