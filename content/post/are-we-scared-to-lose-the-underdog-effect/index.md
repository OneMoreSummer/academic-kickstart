Warning: More ‘Discussion piece’ with assumptions.

In the girls cricket pathway [Relative Age Effect](https://onemoresummer.co.uk/post/what-is-relative-age-effect/) (RAE) is weaker than the boys pathway (assumption, no evidence?) yet there appears to be a significant RAE Reversal (RAER) in senior cricket. This is in terms of [average career length for England Women in ODI & T20](https://onemoresummer.co.uk/post/why-do-later-born-players-have-longer-careers-for-england-women-in-t20-cricket/) cricket. Does this suggest that a ‘smoothing’ of RAE in the boys pathway would have little or no negative impact on RAER experienced in the England Men’s team? There would still likely be a RAER through the [Underdog Effect](https://onemoresummer.co.uk/post/what-is-the-underdog-effect/).

‘Smoothing’ could be simply using [Age Ordered Shirts](https://onemoresummer.co.uk/post/age-ordered-shirt-numbering-fixes-relative-age-effect-during-trials/) during pathway trials, especially early in the pathway, or it could be flexible quotas (5 year rolling averages?).

**Other benefits would include:**

Basic equity of opportunity

Less Q1 inefficiencies (many lost post in early pro years)

Potentially more Q4 super-elites (RAER)

Less Q4 dropout

An International competitive edge

**What this doesn’t take account of:**

Maturation - RAE and Maturation are two entirely independent constructs. Maturation can have more of an effect than RAE, either way (amplify, reduce).

Other ages - training, psychosocial

Genetic factors

But for most early developmental selection points (trials) we’re not taking account of those (enough) anyway.
