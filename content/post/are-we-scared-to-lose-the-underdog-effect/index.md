Warning: More ‘Discussion piece’ with assumptions.

In the girls cricket pathway RAE is weaker than the boys pathway (assumption, no evidence?) yet there appears to be a significant RAE Reversal in senior cricket. This is in terms of average career length for England Women in ODI & T20 cricket. Does this suggest that a ‘smoothing’ of RAE in the boys pathway would have little or no negative impact on RAE Reversal experienced in the England Men’s team? There would still likely be a RAER through the Underdog Effect.

‘Smoothing’ could be simply using Age Ordered Shirts during pathway trials, especially early in the pathway, or it could be flexible quotas (5 year rolling averages?).

**Other benefits would include:**

Basic equity of opportunity

Less Q1 inefficiencies (many lost post in early pro years)

Potentially more Q4 super-elites (RAER)

Less Q4 dropout

An International competitive edge

**What this doesn’t take account of:**

Maturation - RAE and Maturation are two entirely independent constructs. Maturation can have more of an effect than RAE, either way (amplify, reduce).

Other ages - training, psychosocial

Genetic factors

But for most early developmental selection points (trials) we’re not taking account of those (enough) anyway.
