The Super 4s is an annual event, held at Loughborough, for the four regions at the U17 age group, running for the last seven years. The South & West, London & East, the North and the Midlands compete in 3 50 over matches and 2 T20 matches each. It is basically part of the selection process for the Young Lions, Englandâ€™s U19 side.

The data shows evidence of a [Relative Age Effect](https://onemoresummer.co.uk/post/what-is-relative-age-effect/) at this point of the Performance Pathway. It reflects the same findings found for the next point along the pathway, selection for the [Young Lions (U19s)](https://onemoresummer.co.uk/post/rae-increasing-in-england-u19-world-cup-squads/).

These BQs are fairly similar to those found for U19s (Young Lions) World Cup squads. Q3 & Q4 are further reduced. Q1 comes down a little and Q2 actually goes up to match the Q1 level.

Q1 37.3 -> 34.5

Q2 27.2 -> 34.5

Q3 20 -> 17.2

Q4 15.5 -> 13.8*Using the BQ%s for U19 World Cup Squads 2014-2020.

The regions all had avarious levels of RAE with the Midlands with the least differences between Birth Quarters but still with a 67:33 split between Q1/Q2 and Q3/Q4.

**The Highs & Lows**

In 2015 exactly half of all the players were from Q1 alone while in 2018 only 10.4% were from Q3.
