Do later born benefit more from the development process than early born?

Do later born reach the highest levels of a sport more than early born?

Do more later born become professional?

Do relatively more later born become professional?

Who do we mean when we say early born? Q1 only or Q1/Q2?

Is it acceptable to call Q2 later born because we are comparing it with Q1? Or Q3 early born when comparing to Q4?

Does maturation, as well as Relative Age Effect (RAE), play a role in rates of junior/senior transition and reaching the top of a sport? 

When does the underdog effect begin? Is it relative to RAE levels?

What level of RAE, if any, is required to optimise an underdog effect?

What are the mechanisms of an underdog effect?



If we have good answers to most/all of these questions then we may have a construct we can reference, the Underdog Effect. If the answers are weak or unsure then we don’t. What we do currently have is a **hypothesis**, the Underdog Hypothesis (UH), first offered by Gibbs, Jarvis & Dufur (2012) when studying ice hockey. They state ‘*relatively younger players are thought to benefit by more competitive play with their older counterparts*’

These are things we know very little about yet.The highly questionable ‘evidence’ for the UH is often used as a reason for not addressing the RAE for which there is 40 years of solid evidence.

This is first in a series of articles that examine the research that is often quoted for the UH. Recent research has begun to assume the UH as a proven finding. Quick heads up, it’s not.

**Gibbs, Jarvis & Dufur (2012)**

A study of RAE in male Canadian born National (Ice) Hockey League (NHL) professionals and those (the best) that played for the annual All Stars team and Olympic squads.

Main findings:

1. a lower level of Q1 (28%) in professional ice hockey than the levels in junior ice hockey (40%).
2. a lower level of Q1 (17%) in the very highest level teams than in both junior ice hockey (40%) and (probably) compared to Q2, Q3 & Q4 in the professional league.
3. Higher career length for later born.

Let’s look further:

1. No other BQ percentages are stated other than for Q1. Q2 could have been 28% too? Q4 5%? Who knows? It is likely this is evidence for the continuing slow decline in RAE that occurs from midway through junior sport into the start of senior sport and beyond. The figure of 28% is the average for the entire professional cohort, rookies, players in their prime and veterans. From what we know of ‘fading effects’ of RAE it is likely that rookie RAE is higher than prime RAE so an overall % of 28 is perhaps not surprising. A rookie Q1% of 30+% is possible.
2. Again no other BQ%s are stated. Average career length in the NHL according to Gibbs is 7.4 years but some players play into their 40s. So a lot of players are released before 7 years and a gradual number of players retire after 7 years. We know RAE declines slowly. Players selected for the All Stars and Olympic teams that Gibbs looked at were probably selected from players in their prime. It is likely that the RAE profile for this age group is different (lower?) than that for the entire professional cohort. 17% Q1 at the highest levels is then less of a surprise when compared to this source population (prime). 
3. Career lengths in years were Q1 6.9 (-7%), Q2 7.6 (+3%), Q3 7.4 (0) & Q4 7.8 (+5%). Q2 is similar to Q4. Arguably it’s Q1 that is a weak standout. Gibbs et al state their findings were in contrast to findings from Wattie et al (2007).

Do these findings support any answers to the questions at the beginning of the article???
