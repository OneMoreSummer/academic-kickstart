In a data rich sport like cricket we try our best to make informed decisions but do we underestimate the influence of perspective?

Take this following example when looking at [Birth Quarter](https://onemoresummer.co.uk/post/what-is-birth-quarter/) effects.

Currently 699 men have played Test cricket for England. Using a cohort of the 50 highest run scorers we find that Q1s (born Sept-Oct) have a higher average (+4% above the mean) than the other Birth Quarters. When we look at a subset (n=32) of those who average over 40 runs per innings this becomes more significant (9% above the mean, Q1 52, Q2 46, Q3 45, Q4 46 runs). Famous names like Boycott, Sutcliffe, Vaughan and Barrington contribute to this batting average **9% higher** than the other BQs.

So intuitively it would make sense to select more Q1s? They literally score more runs in every innings, right? **This is thinking from an individual perspective**.

The four Q1 players mentioned above, however, are the **only** players that meet this criteria. 4 from 32 which is **half** of what you would expect. (**Q1** **12.5**, Q2 34.38, Q3 25, Q4 28.13).Â 

Batters from BQs 2, 3 & 4 are far more likely to reach this elite level than Q1s who are rare.

Q1 batters only contribute **13.5%** of all runs scored at this level. So intuitively it would make sense to select **fewer** Q1s as the other BQs batters are more (twice as) likely to reach this level. There are literally twice as many BQ 2, 3 & 4s scoring almost as many runs in every innings, right? **This is thinking from a system perspective.**
