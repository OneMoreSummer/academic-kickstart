Much research has been conducted on the [Relative Age Effect](https://onemoresummer.co.uk/post/what-is-relative-age-effect/) over many decades. Virtually all of it (perhaps all?) collects data based on the [Birth Quarter](https://onemoresummer.co.uk/post/what-is-birth-quarter/) percentages of players who have played a particular sport over a period of time. This perhaps doesn’t paint the whole picture and can hide some interesting results. 

It can be argued that in order for a player to have a long career they will have performed to a higher level than a player with a shorter career. This perhaps is a better benchmark for gauging levels of RAE than simply if a player was ever picked or not. Each team selection is a ‘vote’ for that player over a period of time. These votes add up.

Danni Wyatt (Q3) has currently played 116 times for EnglandWomen in T20 internationals. She has the most number of caps and  has been a consistent performer. This should have a greater ‘value’ than that of 3 or 4 players from Q1, for example, who only play 10 matches between them.

When aggregated with other Q3 or Q4 players it tells a different story to the small amount of RAE shown by traditional representations.

Perhaps ‘Matches played by Birth Quarter’ is a better metric than Players by Birth Quarter.
