After eating too much cheese I had a bad dream, where the 22 best Aussie Test players played a match. Here were the teams:

**Cobbers XI**

Hussey

Chappell G

Chappell I

Clarke

Smith

Waugh M

Waugh S

Border (C)

Healy (W)

Warne

McGrath

**Rippers XI**

Langer

Hayden

Taylor

Warner

Ponting (C)

Boon

Harvey

Marsh

Gilchrist (W)

Lee

Lyon

This article is part of a series of articles looking at how RAE plays out at the very highest levels of cricket and is contrary to the (popular) belief that RAE is only relevant to the first half of development pathways.

What do we notice about the teams? Unsurprisingly there are many more batters (18) than bowlers (4) because of the relative physical demands of Test cricket. Of the small number of bowlers there is an equal no of spinners (2) to fast bowlers (2).Â  What else?

What might be more surprising is the (Little) Rippers are ALL Q4s. That is to say 11 of the 22 were all born in the last 3 months of the academic year. Also within the Cobbers only 1 player (McGrath) is a Q1, i.e. born in the first 3 months of the academic year. He is a bowler so no Q1 batters are in the top 22 Aussie Test players by caps. This lack of Q1s aligns with previous articles finding that Q1s perform relatively poorly in Test cricket. <links>

Also the Cobbers are struggling for opening batters whereas there is a surfeit of openers in the Rippers.

Looking further, using the Top 50 Aussie Test Batters and Bowlers by runs and wickets respectively, we find a similar but more nuanced story.
