Every young cricketer has a fair chance of becoming a professional, right? Unfortunately, this suggestion does not reflect the reality of everyoneâ€™s opportunities in cricket. In fact, as well as recently debated racial and socioeconomic factors, two other things can considerably affect your chances: the month of your birth (i.e., your birthdate) and when you mature (i.e., the age at which a player goes through their growth spurt).

At the regional level, the annual Bunbury festival brings together the best 56 U15 boys in the country. If you are lucky enough to be born in September (i.e., the start of the selection year), you are six times more likely to be selected than if you were born in August (i.e., the end of the selection year) (Figure 1). This selection bias occurs due to Relative Age Effects (RAEs), whereby those born at the start of the selection year are overrepresented compared to those born at the end.
