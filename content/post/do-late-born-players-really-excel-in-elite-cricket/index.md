Background: Relative Age Effect, Maturation Bias, Underdog Effect.



There seems to be an assumption that late born and/or late maturers reach higher levels of elite performance in cricket. For example, Tim Wigmore, in 2020 published his book ‘The Best: How Elite Athlete Are Made’, which states 64% of male Test players with over 50 caps are born between March and August (Q3 30%, Q4 34%). But is this just an isolated statistic? In this article we look at data by Matches Played (Caps), Runs & Wickets and at research in this area to find out more.



Why is this important?



Because we don’t want to lose the next Jimmy Anderson or Ben Stokes. Anderson, with the highest number of Test wickets for England and Stokes, our best ever batting all rounder, are certainly elite. They are also late born Q4s.



One of the reasons given for not addressing Relative Age Effect (RAE) in development pathways is that we may lose the Q4 super-elites that they create. It is hypothesized that the smaller numbers of late born (& late maturers) develop better because they are constantly challenged by being outnumbered by their older or more mature peers. While it is highly likely that this level of higher inherent challenge is beneficial, what long term effect does it have in terms of elite performance?



**Test Players with 70+ Caps**

The chart above shows that there is indeed an effect of Birth Quarter (BQ) on super-elite Test cricketers. But perhaps it is not a simple H1/H2* split. Q1 are under represented, Q4 are over represented and Q2 & Q3 are similar. (Nb. H1 represents those born in the first half of the year (Q1 & Q2) and H2 those born in the second half of the year (Q3 & Q4).)

Nb. Within the 36 players there were 3 all rounders who were included as both batters and bowlers.

Player role also has a significant effect. Q4 were overrepresented with 62.5% of the 8* bowlers. Q1, Q2 & Q3 all had a single player.

\* For out and out bowlers 4 of the 5 were Q4 and 1 was a Q3. The other bowlers were all rounders (1 Q1, 1 Q2 and 1 Q4). 

For batters Q4s are over represented but by a smaller margin. Q2 & Q3 are similar and Q1 under-represented.

Top 50 Test Batters by Career Runs**

From the chart above we can see that Q1 batters perform relatively poorer to all other BQs. Q2 is the highest performer both in percentage of players within the top 50 and the percentage of runs scored. Q3 and then Q4 are closely behind. Interestingly Q4 are near a normal 25% representation in terms of runs scored. Q4 also has the lowest career matches per player and average runs per innings.

Top 50 Test Bowlers by Career Wickets**

Q4 Test Bowlers are streets ahead of all other BQs, both in the percentage of players in the top 50 (34%) but also the number of all wickets taken! (40%). Q3s are similar to Q2s and actually slightly worse performers in terms of wickets taken. Q1s, as with the batting, lag behind in both measurements.

Interestingly, within the bowler cohort, there is a difference between spinners and seamers. Spinners have an H2 effect (%s Q1 25, Q2 15, Q3 30, Q4 30) but with seamers Q4 is markedly higher than Q3 (%s Q1 13, Q2 30, Q3 20, Q4 37).

**The Last 20 Years**

\[chart]

As you can see from the chart above, over the last 20 years, England has selected slightly more Q2 & Q3 (% Q1 22.11, Q2 28.42, Q3 28.52, Q4 21.05). In terms of the matches played by these players Q2 is the best with Q3 & Q4 average and Q1 well below par.

Relevant Research**

Jones, Lawrence,Hardy (2018) (1), when analysing super-elite Test players from across the world, found RAE favouring Q1 Batsmen and Spinners. They found no RAE for Fast Bowlers however. Included in the paper was a study of elite Rugby players. This found a  Q1 bias for Rugby backs and a Q4 bias for Forwards. What does this tell us and how does it ‘fit’ with the analysis above?

It matches in terms of Q4 fast bowlers. Within the top Test wicket takers there was a Q4 bias that was also larger amongst fast bowlers (seamers) rather than spinners. It also matches Rugby Forwards with Fast Bowlers. Both disciplines, as argued by Jones et al, are more physical than other disciplines within the game. Here an H2, Underdog Effect, is perhaps in play but only evidenced for Q4s.

Jones et al found Q1 bias in the world’s best batters. This is where the findings above differ radically. Q1 have consistently been relatively poorer performers from a system point of view both in terms of Top 50 run scorers or wicket takers and players reaching 70 caps. In addition they have played fewer matches over the last 20 years than the other BQs despite being picked 22% of the time. 



**Conclusions**

This analysis suggests that there is mixed evidence that later borns (H2) reach higher levels in Test cricket. It was found that Q4s do better at super-elite levels than all other BQs with the effect much stronger in Bowling than Batting. 

In addition, performance over the last 20 years however, from a more mixed group of players, from super-elites through to one test wonders, shows no evidence of later borns performing better.

In general there seems to be a Q1/Q4 (‘classic’? RAE) effect rather than an early/late (H1/H2) effect, especially for bowlers.

Q1s have been shown to do particularly poorly. When selecting Q1s for Test cricket perhaps their other metrics need to be significantly higher? Should a BQ weighting against Q1s players be included in a holistic decision matrix? Should it also have a favourable weighting for Q4 bowlers?
