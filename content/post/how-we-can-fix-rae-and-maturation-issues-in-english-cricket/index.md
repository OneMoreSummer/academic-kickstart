**Why should we care about this?**

We should recognise it’s UNFAIR. All sports should have Equality of Opportunity.

It’s COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE. Elite players are derived from a reduced player pool.

It’s INEFFICIENT.

* Q1/Q2/Early Maturers have much lower rates of becoming established Professionals
* Q1/Q2 Eng ODI Players have 33% shorter careers.

**\
What can we do about it?**

MONITOR 5 Yr Rolling Averages for Age Groups to target a 25% Quarterly distribution for RAE.

MEASURE. Height/Weight Qtrly. Use % of Predicted Adult Height (Khamis-Roche method) to know Biological Age.

USE Biological Age & Chronological Age in assessing Fitness & Performance Data.

USE Age ordered bibs at trials to help coaches make better informed decisions.
