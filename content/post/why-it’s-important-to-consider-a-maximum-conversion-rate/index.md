Conversion Rates (CR) have been used in the research to highlight how later born players (Q3 & Q4) are more likely to transition to the next step in a development pathway or indeed to reach international levels. However, CRs have some drawbacks.

Whenever a Birth Quarter (BQ) dominates the others and a (de)selection point means a significant reduction in the overall numbers, then the more dominant a BQ is the lower it’s CR is likely to be relative to the other BQs.

In this CR example 10 players are selected from a cohort of 100 players who are split into BQ thus:

Q1 50, Q2 30, Q3 15, Q4 5

If all 10 players were selected from just one BQ then the maximum CR% for each BQ would be 20, 33, 67, 100.

The only outcome where Q1 could have a CR higher than Q4 is when there are zero Q4s. If just 1 Q4 is selected then that is a CR of **20%**. In this instance even if all the remaining players were all Q1, the CR% for Q1 would only be **18%**. For Q1:Q4 at 8:2 CR is then 16% & 40% respectively and so on. 

**CRs for uneven groups cannot be compared. Each group has its own maximum CR and different values for every player selected. In this example each Q1 player adds just 2% but each Q4 player 20%. They are different scales. Perhaps a better comparison would be percentage of Max CR?**

Evidence for the [Underdog Effect](https://onemoresummer.co.uk/post/what-is-the-underdog-effect/) is from showing higher CRs for later born players. This however isn't necessarily all down to the greater challenge experienced. Other factors are probably at play such as a natural [Selection Concentration Effect](https://onemoresummer.co.uk/post/is-the-selection-concentration-effect-a-large-part-of-the-underdog-effect/). 

Thus, be very careful when comparing Conversion Rates with a starting imbalance in the cohort.
