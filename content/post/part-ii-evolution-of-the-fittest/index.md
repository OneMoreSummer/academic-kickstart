**England One Day International (ODI) Fast Bowlers born between September and February have SHORTER careers than those born between March-August but we pick MORE of the former.**

**ODI Batsmen born between September and October are the most selected Birth Quarter yet play FEWER matches than those born between November and May.**

In [Part I](https://onemoresummer.co.uk/post/but-weve-just-won-a-world-cup/) we looked at how England One Day International (ODI) players born between September and February play fewer matches over a career (36) than those born between March and August (48), but are selected more often (60:40).

In this article we look at how these figures are influenced by discipline. Namely by allocating the 103 players who have played ODI cricket since 2000 into three groups, Batsmen, Spinners and Fast Bowlers. Players were allocated a single role from what is perceived to be their current main role. So for example Ben Stokes is mainly a batsman and Moeen Ali is mainly a spinner.

**What do we find?**

**ODI Fast Bowlers born between September and February have SHORTER careers (19) than those born between March-August (52) but we pick MORE of the former (26:13).**
