This purpose of this blog is to raise awareness of how Relative Age Effect and Maturation influences selection and development on the player pathway. Perhaps this will lead to changes in policy and practice to ensure ALL players have an EQUAL opportunity.

**\
What do we know?**

RAE exists in cricket.

RAE exists in pathway cricket in Eng up to U17 in and Aus, up to U17, for men and women.

RAE exists in Eng U19 World Cup squads.

RAE exists in Eng ODI selection.

RAE can be up to a 364 day difference in Chronological Age.

Maturation can be up to a 5 year difference in Biological Age.

Maturation effects can be up to 10x those of RAE.

Maturation/Biological Age can be measured (accurately) using the Khamis-Roche method.

5 Ages can affect player selection/development - Chronological, Biological, Relative, Training & Developmental/Cognitive/Behavioral. See Joe Eisenmann for a great explanation:

**Why should we care about this?**

Recognise it‚Äôs UNFAIR. All sports should have Equality of Opportunity.

It‚Äôs COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE. Elite players are derived from a reduced player pool.

It‚Äôs INEFFICIENT.

* Q1/Q2/Early Maturers have much lower ‚Äògraduation‚Äô rates
* Q1/Q2 Eng ODI Players have 33% shorter careers.

**What can we do about it?**

MONITOR 5Yr Rolling Averages for Age Groups to target a 25% dist for RAE.

MEASURE. Height/Weight Qtrly. Use % of Predicted Adult Height (Khamis-Roche method) to know Biological Age.

USE Biological Age & Chron Age in assessing Fitness & Perf Data.

**Who am I?**

I‚Äôm just a parent (and coach) who has experienced the player pathway and noticed (as many do) how the processes of selection/development favour the ‚Äòbigger‚Äô kids. I wanted to find out more and put some facts and figures together with those observations.

**Ignore or Act?**

While this can be seen as an ‚Äòinteresting‚Äô issue and readily understood, little action seems to be happening. It is currently only at the ‚Äòawareness‚Äô level. This blog is a small attempt to counter this. There are many, many biases and systemic issues in cricket. RAE & Maturation is just one of them.
